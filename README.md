# Last_Version_Sigma_Rocket
I designed this card for the Teknofest high altitude rocket competition that I participated in 2023. This is the last version of my trials. I had to design with this way because of some financial and team-wise things.

This card is the flight control card of our high altitude rocket. While I used the STM32f407 as the processor in the card I designed, I used various sensors for requirements such as pressure, gyro, gps and telemetry with different protocols. I used an SD card to store the data from the sensors and a USB connector to provide data transfer. The main purpose of the card was to ensure the recovery of the rocket in line with the data from these sensors. That's why I also designed two recovery circuits with motor drivers and mosfets. This is one of the first attempts of the designs I made for the card to be used in this rocket.
